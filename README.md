# Bootstrap Practice

A place for me to practice and demo the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

## About

This is a website about creating buttons and add a JS function. I also added some bootstraps

It contains one page:

- buttons.html - contains 5 buttons that respond to click events
- styled-buttons.html -contains 10 buttons styled with css/bootstraps with eventlisteners

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

## Roadmap

- [x] buttons.html - the HTML page to work on buttons that respond with JavaScript to clicks
- [x] buttons.js - contains the actual code to make the buttons live
- [x] buttons.css - contains classes to style the buttons
- [x] styled-buttons.html styled onle one of the buttons with an ID
- [x] styled-buttons.css change the #ID to a class and use this to style all the buttons
- [x] styled-buttons.js put an event listener on at least two of the buttons so that they respond to clicks
